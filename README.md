## What is Zircuit?

Zircuit is a fully EVM-compatible zero-knowledge rollup that combines advanced AI, zero-knowledge proofs, and robust infrastructure to deliver unmatched safety, performance, and scalability. Every transaction is protected at the sequencer level by AI, making it a secure environment for both users and developers.

## About These Examples

The code in this repository serves as a practical guide for developers looking to leverage Zircuit's capabilities. It currently includes the following examples:

- **[erc2771-gelato-relay](./erc2771-gelato-relay/)**: How to implement sponsored transactions using Gelato Relay with ERC2771 context on Zircuit.
- **[erc7412-redstone](./erc7412-redstone/)**: How to integrate RedStone Oracles with a smart contract using the ERC-7412 standard on Zircuit.
- **[zrc-token-subgraph](./zrc-token-subgraph/)**: How to index ERC-20 token transfers on Zircuit using The Graph protocol.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to these examples.
